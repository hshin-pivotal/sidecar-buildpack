The `sidecar-buildpack` is a https://www.cloudfoundry.org/[Cloud Foundry] buildpack that allows any
application to use Netflix OSS https://github.com/Netflix/eureka[Eureka] and https://github.com/Netflix/zuul[Zuul]
for service discovery and proxying respectively - regardless of whether or not it is a Spring Boot, Spring, or even a Java application.

## Usage
* Start with an existing `Cloud Foundry` application
* add a `.sidecar_buildpacks` file to the root of the application containing a link to your application's current buildpack (git repo or .tgz) _e.g._ https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack.git
* _(Optional)_ implement a '/health' endpoint that returns the following:
** the `content-type` header: `Content-Type: application/json`
** body: `{"status": "UP"}`
** Eureka will show your app as 'Down' unless you properly implement the `/health` endpoint
* if your application uses the https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#start-commands[Command Attribute] in its `manifest.yml`, move the command into a https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/prod-server.html#procfile[Procfile]
* Deploy with:
+
```bash
$ cf push -b https://github.com/rhardt-pivotal/sidecar-buildpack
```

## Sample Apps
The following consist of a suite of apps that will register with a eureka instance via a sidecar and can then reference
one another.  They each expose the self-explanatory endpoints `/javafortune`
(the original Spring Boot Fortune Teller service), `/rubyfortune`, `/nodefortune`, `/pythonfortune`,
and `/gofortune`

## Bundled Sidecar
The actual sidecar functionality resides in a Spring Boot jar the link:resources/sidecar[Resources directory].
The repo for that jar is https://github.com/rhardt-pivotal/sidecar-jar[here]
